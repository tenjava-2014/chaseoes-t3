About
-----------

This plugin is called __RandomRain__. It's purpose is to make it randomly rain upon random players. But there's a twist, this isn't your typical rain, it's special rain. Stay on your toes for random gameplay twists coming directly out of the sky above you! 

You can be rained upon, randomly and without warning, with any of the following types:

- __Cats and Dogs__: It can literally rain cats and dogs! Be prepared for random downpours of ocelots and wolves.
- __Anvils__: Watch out, anvils are nasty! You better get prepared for anvils randomly falling out of the sky and landing on your head.
- __Deadly Potions__: Splash potions are cool until poison, weakness, and instant damage potions randomly fall out of the sky and hit you.
- __Diamonds__: Less deadly, more fun. Everyone likes diamonds, especially when they fall out of the sky. There's even a chance of some emeralds falling too!
- __Rainbows__: Bright, colourful, swirly potion splash effects! They're harmless but can be scary, as the effect (and sound) is completely random.
- __Experience Orbs__: Everyone hates grinding to get experience (xp), so some might fall out of the sky for your enjoyment.
- __Creepers__: More deadly than diamonds and rainbows! Creepers will randomly fall out of the sky, on top of you. There's even a chance of some being powered!
- __Eggs__: Everyone loves chickens, but more importantly, you might get randomly hit with their eggs from above. Don't worry, they don't actually reduce your health.

Usage
-----------

Just install the plugin by dropping it in your plugins folder and it's ready to go! Just wait, and your players will need to change their pants after being scared by randomly being rained upon by creepers or anvils.

Commands & Permissions
-----------

For testing purposes (or for your enjoyment of trolling) you can manually invoke the different types of rain by using a command.
